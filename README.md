# art-viewer-day-1
Day 1 goals for your repo. I'm using Vite here, but you don't have to! All we're looking for is an existing repo, with *something* inside of it. As a stretch goal, you can try and deploy it to github pages to get that out of the way like I have here! But the minimum is the existence of your organization, and repo.
